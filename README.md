# Data-Cleaning-and-PreProcessing
This Python code demonstrates a complete data cleaning and preprocessing pipeline for machine learning using pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn. It begins by loading a raw CSV dataset and displaying its structure using .head(), .info(), and .describe() to understand column types, missing values, and statistical summaries. A heatmap is then used to visualize missing data, which is handled by either dropping or filling values. The code removes duplicates, converts columns to appropriate types (like datetime), and encodes categorical data using label encoding and one-hot encoding. It visualizes numerical feature distributions and detects outliers using histograms and boxplots, then removes outliers with the Z-score method. All numerical columns are scaled using StandardScaler to standardize feature values. Finally, the dataset is split into training and testing sets using an 80/20 ratio, preparing the data for training machine learning models. This pipeline ensures clean, consistent, and model-ready data.
