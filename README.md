# Data-Cleaning-and-PreProcessing
This code loads the Titanic dataset from Kaggle using pandas and begins by exploring its structure with .head(), .info(), and .describe(). A heatmap is plotted using seaborn to visualize missing data. The 'Cabin' column is dropped due to excessive missing values, while missing values in 'Age' are filled with the median and 'Embarked' with the mode. Categorical columns like 'Sex' and 'Embarked' are label-encoded or one-hot encoded appropriately. Unnecessary columns such as 'Name', 'Ticket', and 'PassengerId' are dropped to avoid irrelevant noise. Histograms and boxplots are used to visualize distributions and identify outliers, which are then removed using Z-score filtering from the scipy.stats module. Numerical features are scaled using StandardScaler, and finally, the cleaned dataset is split into training and testing sets using train_test_split, preparing it for machine learning model training with a focus on the target column 'Survived'.
